# pytorch-streamloader

**The dataloader to stream videos or text or anything in temporally coherent batches.**

## What is it?

Current implementation of iterable dataset does not seem to cover well use-case of streaming several videos/ text/ audio in temporally coherent batches.
Here i provide a simple implementation of streaming with multiprocessing and pytorch.
This is mainly to get feedback and understand how to do this better :-) (but if you find this useful don't hesitate to give me feedback as well)
